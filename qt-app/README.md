# Vehicle Speed Simulation System

A Qt-based 2D vehicle simulation application featuring a car driving on professional road graphics with real-time speed control and future MQTT integration capabilities.

## 🚗 Features

- **2D Road Simulation**: Vehicle automatically drives on a professional road background
- **Real-time Speed Control**: Adjust vehicle speed using slider and buttons
- **Start/Stop Controls**: Start and stop the vehicle simulation
- **Waypoint Navigation**: Car follows a predefined path with smooth movement
- **Professional Graphics**: Uses high-quality road assets for realistic appearance
- **LGPL Compliant**: Fully compliant with Qt LGPL v3 licensing requirements
- **MQTT Ready**: Framework prepared for real-time data transmission to mobile apps

## 📋 Requirements

- Qt 6.9.1 or later
- MinGW 13.1.0 64-bit compiler (Windows)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.16 or later

## 🏗️ Building the Project

### Using Qt Creator (Recommended)
1. Open Qt Creator
2. Open the project file `CMakeLists.txt`
3. Configure the project to use MinGW 13.1.0 64-bit kit
4. Build and run the project

### Using Command Line
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.9.1/mingw_64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build the project
cmake --build . --config Debug

# Run the application
./bin/VehicleSpeedCheckout.exe
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to begin vehicle movement
2. **Speed Control**: Use the slider or +/- buttons to control vehicle speed
3. **Stop Simulation**: Click "Stop" to halt the vehicle
4. **Real-time Display**: Watch the vehicle move along the road path
5. **Interactive Waypoints**: Click on the road to add custom waypoints (right-click to reset)
